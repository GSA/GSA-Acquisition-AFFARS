			      <span class="ph autonumber">AF PGI 5315.407-91</span> Formula Pricing Agreements (FPA)</h3>
		    <div class="body conbody">
			      <p class="p List1">(a) An FPA is any pricing agreement with a contractor that identifies the categories of purchases to be covered (e.g., F-l00 replenishment spares) and:</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Establishes the pricing methodology for more than one future contract action; and/or,</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) Establishes a pricing methodology for corporate contracts and strategic sourcing agreements; and/or,</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Specifies the direct cost inputs and the rates and/or factors to be applied to identified bases plus profit or fee.</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) FPAs are not Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRA). An FPRA is usually limited to an agreement on individual rates or factors (including Cost Estimating Relationships (CER)), applies to items not specified in the agreement, and is required to be used by all buying activities.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(b) A contracting officer may consider establishing FPAs in order to reduce administrative costs and lead times associated with negotiation of large numbers of contract actions for items that can be identified or described in the agreement. FPAs typically are established only with contractors under Government in-plant contract administration cognizance and having a resident DCAA auditor. Contracting offices contemplating an FPA with a contractor without in-plant administration and/or DCAA representation, should do so only if they have the staffing/capability to administer the FPA themselves. Use of an FPA does not exempt proposals from TINA or other applicable laws or regulations.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(c) Content and Structure of FPAs. All FPAs should:</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Be in writing and signed by the contracting officer and an authorized representative of the contractor;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) Cover no cost elements that would require discrete estimating and analysis;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Identify all rates and factors that are a part of the FPA. An FPA may reference FPRA(s), as long as it prescribes the effect and treatment of any changes in the FPRA(s);</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) Establish terms and conditions covering application of the agreement, its expiration date, and any data requirements for systematic monitoring (e.g., provisions for review of actual cost data) to ensure its continuing validity;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(5) Provide for cancellation at the option of either party;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(6) Require the contractor to notify the contracting officer and the cognizant contract auditor of any significant change in its estimating/accounting system or the cost or pricing data and describe the impact on the FPA;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(7) Require the contractor to identify in each specific pricing proposal where the agreement is used:</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) The FPA and the date of the latest certification of cost or pricing data supporting it; and,</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) Any items in the proposal that are not priced under the agreement;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(8) Indicate that the FPA should not be used if the contractor’s purchasing, estimating or accounting systems are disapproved by the Government;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(9) Allow for the contracting officer, or designated representative, to perform detailed cost or price analysis on random samples of proposed items and/or items that have unit prices that are significantly higher than previous buys;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(10) Be supported by certified cost or pricing data (see FAR 15.403-4) and a signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data that is submitted when agreement on the FPA is reached (and annually thereafter);</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(11) Provide that contractual documents for items priced using the FPA, include:</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) The statement at FAR 52.215-10, Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data; and,</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) A clause incorporating the FPA by reference.</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(12) Be based on a pricing methodology that ensures that unit prices are in proportion to the item’s base cost (see FAR 15.404-1(f)) and that prices may be adjusted, if it is found that:</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) Cost or pricing data supporting the FPA were not accurate, current or complete; or,</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) The price was developed through incorrect application of the FPA.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(d) Contracting office responsibilities, as appropriate: </p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Establish appropriate approval levels for FPAs;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) Maintain a list of FPAs that identifies each company and the group of items covered under each FPA;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Conduct periodic reviews of FPAs and contract actions priced using FPAs; and,</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) Establish agreements with appropriate contract administration offices to provide field pricing support, negotiation support, and administrative support of Air Force FPAs.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(e) Contracting officer responsibilities, as appropriate:</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Obtain field pricing support, including contract audit and technical reviews, in the evaluation and negotiation of FPAs;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) Prepare a price negotiation memorandum covering the pricing factors used in each FPA, including a discussion on how profit or fee was calculated [using <a class="xref" href="https://www.wgl.milcloud.mil/wgl/" target="_blank">
					          <u class="ph u">Weighted Guidelines</u>
				        </a> or an alternate structured approach];</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Semi-annually request (through the ACO) the DCAA resident auditor to determine if the contractor is complying with FPA procedures;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) Annually review each FPA to determine its validity by evaluating recorded cost data, and renegotiate the FPA if appropriate;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(5) Determine the effect changed conditions may have on the FPA’s validity. Cancel an FPA when appropriate and notify all interested parties;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(6) Do not use a cancelled FPA;</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(7) Conduct an evaluation of each proposal under an FPA in order to ensure that the FPA applies to the items and to determine the reasonableness of discrete cost inputs and any non-covered costs (e.g., nonrecurring costs);</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) Compare proposed prices with prior prices, Government estimates, and purchase request estimates to ensure reasonableness, as use of an FPA does not relieve the CO of the responsibility to ensure that the price is fair and reasonable;</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) Conduct detailed cost analysis on random samples of proposed items and/or items that have unit prices that are significantly higher than previous buys; and, (iii) Ensure that individual contract actions priced using the FPA comply with the terms of the FPA.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(f) Contractors could have FPAs, or similar agreements, with other Air Force activities and/or non-Air Force activities. COs may consider using these agreements, but should take care to ensure that the FPA to be used addresses all aspects of their acquisition situation.</p>

			      <p class="p Normal">For all AFRL Sites: consider the following technical and cost factors and/or subfactors:</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(a) Cost is a substantial factor in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) source selections, but it is significantly less important than all other factors combined in determining the basis for award. </p>
			      <p class="p List1">(b) Technical:</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Technical approach: The soundness of the offeror's technical approach, including the offeror's demonstrated understanding of the technical requirement.</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) Qualification: The quantity and quality of experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel relevant to the proposed task. The quantity and quality of the offeror's corporate experience relevant to the proposed task.</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Management: The degree to which the offeror demonstrates the ability to effectively and efficiently manage and administer the program to a successful conclusion. </p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) Facilities: The degree to which the proposed facilities enable accomplishment of the proposed effort.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(c) Past Performance Information (PPI):</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1)Unlike contracts for supplies and services, most S&amp;T contracts are directed toward objectives for which the work or methods cannot be precisely described in advance and it is difficult to judge the probabilities of success or the likelihood of the proposed approach being achieved. Some approaches offer little or no early assurance of full success (see FAR 35.002). Due to the trial and error nature of the S&amp;T environment, many problems and failures are routine and expected. Therefore, PPI may not be a significant discriminator in S&amp;T source selection decisions.</p>
			      <p class="p List2" id="AFFARS_AFMC_PGI_5315_3E__p__AFMC_PGI_5315.402-90">(2)When PPI is used in S&amp;T source selections, tailor the type of past performance data to be collected and the manner in which it is to be evaluated to the specific acquisition. Evaluation of ad hoc past performance information should either be incorporated in other evaluation factors and/or subfactors (e.g., technical approach, qualification, management, facilities) or used as a stand-alone factor or subfactor as appropriate. PCOs should review “Guidance for the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (<a class="xref" href="https://www.cpars.gov/pdfs/CPARS-Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">

			      <p class="p List1">(a) To facilitate timely award of sole source contract actions, contracting officers are strongly encouraged to conduct proposal kickoff and proposal walk through meetings (see <a class="xref" href="#AFFARS_AF_PGI_5315_402_90">AF PGI 5315.402-90</a> ). To ensure these meetings are successful, preparation is important. The following tailorable Meeting Checklists which cover important topics regarding prime and supplier proposal adequacy are provided to guide these meetings. Contracting officers should recommend that the Prime Contractor also conduct these meetings with their subcontractors and tailor these checklists for this purpose. It is a common best practice in industry to host supplier kickoff meetings and training sessions for subcontractors that may have difficulty supplying adequate proposals.</p>

			      <p class="p Normal">A Request for Information (RFI) is generally used as part of market research to determine industry interest in an anticipated acquisition; to obtain estimated prices, delivery or other market information for planning purposes; and to ensure industry understanding of Government requirements. PCOs should ensure the requirements at FAR 15.209(c) are followed and FAR clause 52.215-3, “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes”, is included in the RFI.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(a) Call for Concepts (or Concept Data Call) – a type of RFI in which the Government seeks industry information to understand state-of-the-art technologies and recommendations to formulate initial capability documents and/or identify Government technology gaps and shortfalls.&nbsp; This type of information is usually for new and emerging technologies and will require a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Life Cycle Cost (LCC) estimate with high level schedule milestones for development, initial operational capability (IOC), and long term sustainment.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(b) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) – a type of RFI&nbsp;in which the Government posts a summary description of the technical requirement and seeks industry information to understand what sources and capabilities are available.&nbsp; Often a Sources Sought synopsis is followed by an announcement of an Industry Days or may include an announcement for an Industry Days.</p>
			      <p class="p List1" id="AFFARS_SMC_PGI_5315_3D__p__SMC_PGI_5315.3_5">(c) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) – a type of RFI in which an estimate is provided by industry at the Government’s request and may be used in the early stages of technology development or in a project when the scope and technical requirements have not been fully defined.&nbsp; Requesting a ROM may also be useful to the Government at critical design stages.&nbsp; The main purpose of the ROM estimate is to provide decision-makers&nbsp;with the information necessary to make a decision on whether it makes sense to move forward with the project based on the estimated work effort anticipated, in terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion time and&nbsp;cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; A ROM may be useful to project planners in reducing the risk of uncertainty with regard to cost outcomes for both parties when project details have yet to be identified. </p>

When issued in a near-final state, the DRFP offers an opportunity for industry to provide meaningful feedback on the requirements and model contract that can be considered by the acquisition team prior to the start of a source selection, possibly saving time by reducing the need for solicitation amendments. It also allows for a more open dialog with industry partners in advance of the source selection, when interaction is much more structured. Finally, it allows offerors to begin developing proposals in advance of the final RFP release, allowing the PCO to provide for a shorter window of time between final RFP release and proposal receipt. Note, however, that if the draft RFP is substantially different from the final RFP, the PCO may need provide additional time for offerors to adjust their proposals. </p>
