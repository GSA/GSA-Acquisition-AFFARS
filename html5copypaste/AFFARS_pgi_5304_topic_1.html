			      <p class="p Normal">Distribution through Electronic Data Access (EDA) is accomplished via the automated contract writing system (e.g., ConWrite, PD2). The contracting officer is responsible for distribution to any parties that do not have EDA accounts (e.g., contractor, program office). Personnel at Los Angeles AFB using ConWrite should follow the procedures below for contract award and distribution. Chief of the contracting office (COCO) at Peterson AFB, Kirtland AFB, and in Operational Contracting at Los Angeles AFB should establish comparable local procedures for contract award and distribution and disseminate those procedures to their personnel. </p>
			      <p class="p List1">(a) New contracting personnel or personnel changing organizations can obtain ConWrite access from the SMC/PKX ConWrite administrator. See instructions at the <a class="xref" href="https://insidesmc.losangeles.af.mil/sites/pk/div/pkf/conwrite/default.aspx" target="_blank">

				        </a> form. Requests that fail to follow the procedures in this MP may not be awarded and may be returned for correction. If requests are returned for correction, the Award Distro team will provide comments in the electronic comment form. The contracting officer will document resolution of the comments in the form prior to resubmitting for award and distribution. If the documentation cannot be corrected on the same day, the contracting officer may be directed to re-sign the document as of the date the request is resubmitted. Disputes will be elevated to the COCO and the SMC/PKX Division Chief. </p>
			      <p class="p List1">(c) In order to meet the contract action reporting (CAR) timelines in FAR 4.604(b), award requests should be submitted on the same day the contracting officer signs the contract action. If same-day award distribution is required, notify the Award Distro team and submit the request by 1200 PT to provide sufficient time to complete the award distribution process. When extenuating circumstances require late day or after hours award distribution, the COCO should contact the Award Distro team prior to 1200 PT to coordinate support. For same-day award, either the contract specialist or the contracting officer should be available until the electronic award distribution action is completed.</p>
			      <p class="p List1" id="AFFARS_pgi_5304_topic_12__p__SMC_PGI_5304.402">(d) Upon completion of electronic distribution, the Award Distro team will notify the contracting officer and contract specialist via email that a copy of the contractual document has been posted to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Electronic Document Access (EDA) and that the CAR has been transmitted to FPDS-NG. Contracting officers should include this email in the official contract file as evidence that the CAR has been submitted in a timely manner IAW FAR 4.604(b)(2).</p>

			      <span class="ph autonumber">SMC PGI 5304.403</span> Responsibilities of Contracting Officers</h3>
		    <div class="body conbody">
			      <p class="p Normal">For Department of Defense acquisitions in which the contractor will have access to or will produce classified information, the requirements for the contractor to safeguard that information are contained on a DD Form 254 (“Contract Security Classification Specification”), which is a contract attachment. The applicable rules addressing these information security requirements come to us from a series of Executive Orders and are implemented in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22-M), the Industrial Security Regulation (DoD 5220.22-R), and the Air Force Industrial Security Program Instruction (AFI 16-1406).</p>
			      <p class="p Normal">The DD Form 254 does not itself define what information is classified – the documents that do so are typically incorporated by reference into the form – but rather it instructs the contractor how to behave when it handles and/or produces classified information. Because the DD Form 254 is the mechanism for communicating security requirements to contractors – and holding contractors accountable – solicitations should include a complete and accurate form that allows contractors to estimate the costs of the security measures it will need to provide during performance. Ultimately, the DD Form 254 is attached to awarded contracts and listed in Section J.</p>
			      <p class="p Normal">The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Contract Classification System (NCCS) is the primary tool used to accomplish DD Forms 254. Generally, the DD Form 254 is prepared by the program office, coordinated through the appropriate security office(s) (see below), and certified by the contracting officer in Block 17. Contracting officers are not expected to be expert in the security requirements, but would do well to keep the following in mind when reviewing the document for certification:</p>
			      
				        Ensure appropriate clauses and provisions have been included in Section I of the contract as prescribed in FAR / DFARS / AFFARS.
				        Ensure that the necessary security office review and coordination have been obtained. For all contracts dealing with classified information, this means SMC/ENX. For Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Block 10e), add SMC/INS. For Special Access Program (SAP) information (Block 10f), add AFOSI/PJ. Coordination by security offices may be evidenced by signature in Block 13 or via the NCCS.
				        Ensure the prospective contractor possesses the Facility Security Clearance required by Block 1a. If not, the contractor will need to be sponsored to receive the necessary clearance level by the Government submitting a request to the Defense Security Service (DSS). Contractor facility clearances may be verified on the <a class="xref" href="http://www.dss.mil/" target="_blank">
						            <u class="ph u">DSS</u>
						            <u class="ph u"> website</u>
					          </a>.
				        Ensure the administrative information included on the form is accurate, such as solicitation number (Block 2c) or contract number (Block 2a), contractor data (Block 6), and Government information (Blocks 16 and 17).
				        Pay particular attention to any information included in Blocks 13 and 14, which are the line items used to include any contract-unique requirements, non-standard guidance, and program-specific information. Ensure any additional (likely cost-bearing) requirements added in Blocks 13 and 14 are reasonable and necessary.
				         Ensure that the distribution list in Block 18 is accurate. Paragraph 3.3 of AFI 16-1406 has detailed distribution instructions; contracting officers should also ensure the form is distributed to the coordinating security offices.
			      
			      <p class="p Normal">The DD Form 254 and associated instruction sheet can be found on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Directives/forms/%20" target="_blank">
					          <u class="ph u">DoD Publications website</u>
				        </a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			      <p class="p Normal">From time to time, the security community may recommend for program office consideration changes to the DD Form 254 to bring it in line with current security requirements. Keep in mind that revisions to the form are changes to contract terms equivalent to revisions to other performance requirements such as those found in statements of work and require negotiation with the contractor, and may very likely incur additional cost. Revised DD Forms 254 are incorporated into the contract via modification.</p>
			      <p class="p Normal">Note that the DD Form 254 does not include a period of performance or a date indicating its validity timeframe – as an attachment to the contract, it expires when the contract does. (See the Description section, item c., of the Instructions for Completing DD Form 254 referenced in AFI 16-1406.)</p>
			      <p class="p Normal">Do not issue a revised DD Form 254 when exercising an option. There are no changes to contract terms, and the initial / current DD Form 254 is still valid (remember, there are no expiration dates associated with the Form). (See the section for Block 3b, item (2), of the Instructions for Completing DD Form 254 referenced in AFI 16-1406.) DD Forms 254 do not require re-certification or re-coordination for option exercises.</p>
			      <p class="p Normal" id="AFFARS_pgi_5304_topic_14__p__SMC_PGI_5304.606">Upon contract completion, a “Final” DD Form 254 may be issued if it is necessary to grant the contractor additional retention of classified materials (following the end of the contract’s period of performance) beyond the automatic two-year retention period authorized by the NISPOM.</p>

Therefore, a current and accurate conformed contract is important to have readily available as a basis for sound decision-making, not only to the contracting office but also to the entire program team and staff review team. Although contracting officers are ultimately responsible, all members of the acquisition team should take an active role in maintaining the contract file and ensuring the conformed contract is up to date. As a helpful companion to the conformed contract, contracting officers may wish to keep a log (using a spreadsheet with line items for each modification is a good choice) of summary-level statistics such as contract value and funded levels (overall and by CLIN, cumulative and by modification, and broken out by component such as cost, award fee, fixed fee, etc.), accounting classification reference number (ACRN), periods of performance, option exercise dates, etc.</p>
