               <p>(a)(i) The 1279 Report is used for Congressional notification and public announcement of contract awards and other transactions that exceed the DoD threshold.

                     <p>(ii) Alternate 1279 reporting for the announcement of source selection contract awards. If the awardee information cannot be provided three days in advance, the report does not need to identify the offeror that has been selected for award. Insert “Source Selection Information - Will Advise” for “Contractor Data” and either "$50 million or above" or "below $50 million" for “Face Value” and “Funding Data”. When using these procedures, provide the successful offeror, face value of the award, and funding data to <xref format="html"
