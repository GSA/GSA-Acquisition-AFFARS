For most SMC actions, contracting officers should have a certified purchase request in hand before executing the contract action.  A contracting officer may release a request for proposal (RFP) conditioned upon the availability of funds only when authorized under FAR <ph outputclass="FAR" class="- topic/ph ">32.703-2</ph> or when following the procedures in AFFARS MP5332.7.  </p>

However, in these circumstances the contracting officer should obtain written evidence that the funding is being reserved in-house by the program control office or that the program/requirement has been included in the Presidentâ€™s budget as submitted to Congress and that, although not presently available, a reasonable expectation exists that funding will be authorized and available upon the enactment of the Authorization and Appropriations Acts.  At SMC, this documentation is captured in a report from the Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCaRS) tool.  The CCaRS report should be included in Tab 1 of the contract file as evidence of funds availability.</p>
