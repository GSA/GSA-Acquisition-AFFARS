         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a) Recommended approval authority for the use of an early effective date is the chief of the contracting office. After reaching agreement on terms, conditions, price, and if funds are available, the contracting officer may advise a prospective contractor in writing of the Government’s intent to use an effective date before the contract mailing (award/signed) date. The early effective date should not be earlier than the price agreement date.</p>

Also recommend stating that if there is no contract, all incurred costs should be at the contractor’s own risk. </p>
