			      <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a) This guidance is for the acquisition of long-lead items initiated with appropriated advance procurement funds to protect production end item delivery schedules. (For long-lead items procured with other than advance procurement funds, contracting officers should follow standard contracting procedures, including undefinitized contract action (UCA) procedures prescribed in DFARS 217.74.) </p>

				        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b "> </b>Contracting for long-lead items using congressionally appropriated advance procurement funds is a special contracting method used to protect planned production schedules for major system acquisitions. This approach provides Congress with the flexibility to make decisions on annual funding levels while providing a measure of program stability. Advance procurement funds need to be included in the budget request. If authorized by Congress, funds are made available well in advance of full production program release.</p>
			      <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) A definitive contract is preferred. When it is possible to award a definitive contract using advance procurement funds, the contracting officer follows normal contracting procedures.</p>
			      <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) It is usually not practical to initiate the long-lead effort using fully definitized contract procedures when final production quantities remain unknown. Therefore, procedures similar to those for a UCA are used to initiate the long-lead effort. In recognition of this unique situation, Congress has exempted long-lead efforts initiated with advance procurement funds from the requirements of <xref href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/2326.html"

			      <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(3) After the award of the undefinitized long-lead contract, the contracting officer should make every effort to negotiate a definitive contract amount for the total contract effort based on the buy profile for which the advance procurement funds were authorized. The use of a flexible pricing approach such as pricing for a range in quantity or negotiating a pricing methodology that will allow for an extrapolation of a fixed-price is highly encouraged. These techniques greatly reduce reproposal activity and facilitate a quick reaction to variations in the related end item quantity between the planned and appropriated quantities. When this is not possible and delays in definitizing the contract result in termination liability exceeding the advance procurement funds, the use of procurement funds may be authorized to avoid production breaks<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">. If procurement funds are added to the contract effort prior to definitization,</i> the long-lead effort is then treated as a part of the production effort and is subject to all the procedures and reporting requirements governing UCAs covered in DFARS 217.74.</p>

			      <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p " xtrf="CheckMapping">(iv) Obtain a written technical evaluation for the long-lead items that focuses on the need for the items to protect end item delivery schedules. This evaluation should be included in the contract file; and</p>
			      <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p " xtrf="CheckMapping">(v) Conduct a thorough evaluation of the contractorâ€™s termination liability amount, expenditure profile, and NTE proposal. The evaluation of the termination liability estimate should focus on the content of the estimate, the methodology used to develop the estimate, and the termination liability time phasing. The evaluation should be included in the contract file.</p>

			      <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p " xtrf="CheckMapping">(i) The undefinitized long-lead contract should include:</p>
			      <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) An NTE for the long-lead effort;</p>

			      <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) Stipulate that the purpose of the undefinitized long-lead contract initiated with advance procurement funds is to protect the end item delivery schedule contained in Section F of the Schedule and that the contractor is contractually obligated to meet this schedule except as provided for in the Long Lead Limitation of Government Liability clause; and</p>
			      <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Require the contractor to submit an NTE proposal and agree to an NTE for the total contract effort (if an NTE for the total contract effort was not previously obtained) if definitization of the total contract effort has not occurred before termination liability exceeds advance procurement funds on the contract and, if necessary, add procurement funds to protect the end item delivery schedules.

			      <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) Address adequate remedies if a definitive contract cannot be reached by the target date or within any extension granted by the contracting officer. These remedies may include, with approval from the original approval authority for the undefinitized long-lead contract, the contracting officerâ€™s unilateral determination of a reasonable fee for the long-lead effort and/or a reasonable price for the total contract effort if a NTE has been established. The contracting officerâ€™s determination is subject to contractor appeal as provided in the Disputes clause.</p>

            xtrf="CheckMapping">(iv) Comply with all UCA requirements contained in DFARS 217.74.
