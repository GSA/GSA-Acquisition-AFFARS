The following tailorable Meeting Checklists which cover important topics regarding prime and supplier proposal adequacy are provided to guide these meetings. Contracting officers should recommend that the Prime Contractor also conduct these meetings with their subcontractors and tailor these checklists for this purpose.  It is a common best practice in industry to host supplier kickoff meetings and training sessions for subcontractors that may have difficulty supplying adequate proposals.<ol class="- topic/ol ">
