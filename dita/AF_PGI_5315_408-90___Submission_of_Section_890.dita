 							class="- topic/p ">Prior to submission of Section 890 Pilot Program candidates to OUSD/DPC-PCI, it is recommended that contracting officers first vet potential pilots through their local pricing/policy office.  Upon concurrence of MAJCOM Pricing, AFMC/PKF will serve as the overall Air Force focal point to determine viable candidates and will work with teams to ensure they have a thoughtful implementation plan prior to engaging OUSD/DPC-PCI for acceptance.</p>
