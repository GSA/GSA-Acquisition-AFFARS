If the contractor persists in refusing to provide subcontract reviews and evaluations, the contracting officer should withhold the award and elevate the matter to management for resolution.</p>

Contracting officers should consider taking action described in DFARS 215.407-5 when a contractor consistently fails to provide adequate subcontract reviews and evaluations. If a subcontract represents a significant cost risk to the Government, the contracting officer should consider:</p>
