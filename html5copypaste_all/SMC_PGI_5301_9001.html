			      <p class="p List1">(b) Clearance process. </p>
			      <p class="p List2">(1) Clearance approval authority (CAA) is at the SCO or DAS(C)/ADAS(C) level. The clearance review is conducted by the assigned committee reviewer in conjunction with the pricing reviewer and program attorney (as applicable) using the process in <a class="xref" href="SMC_PGI_5301_602_2.html">SMC PGI 5301.602-2</a>(c)(ii).</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(2) CAA is the COCO or below. COCOs establish procedures for conducting clearance reviews.</p>
			      <p class="p List2">(3) Scheduling the Clearance Briefing with SCO, DAS(C), or ADAS(C).</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) CAA is the SCO. The contracting officer schedules the clearance briefing with the PK Exec after legal, committee, and pricing reviewers (as applicable) have submitted their comments to the contracting officer. The contracting officer notifies the clearance reviewer(s) of the briefing date and time.</p>
			      <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) CAA is the DAS(C) or ADAS(C). The contracting officer is responsible for submitting the notification of anticipated Business Clearance Session in accordance with AFFARS <a class="xref" href="MP5301_9001.html">MP5301.9001</a>(i)(1)(i), paragraph (A)<em class="ph i">(1)</em> or (B)<em class="ph i">(1)</em>. For situational awareness, the contracting officer should copy the pricing reviewer, the committee reviewer and the COCO on the notification. Prior to submitting the Business Clearance documentation to SAF/AQC, the documentation should be reviewed in accordance with the clearance review procedures described in <a class="xref" href="SMC_PGI_5301_9001.html">SMC PGI 5301.9001</a>(b)(1). </p>
			      <p class="p List2">(4) Clearance Briefings. For clearances to the SCO, DAS(C), or ADAS(C), contracting officers are highly encouraged to use the templates identified below. SAF/AQC updates its clearance templates periodically. When DAS(C) or ADAS(C) is the CAA, follow AFFARS <a class="xref" href="MP5301_9001.html">MP5301.9001</a>(i)(1)(i) to ensure that the applicable SMC template below captures all necessary content for the specific action. For clearances at or below the COCO, the CAA determines whether or not a briefing is required. If the CAA does not require a briefing, the contract file should document the clearance approval and identify the information relied upon in making the clearance decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
