        resolutions to include such information as the disposition (denied or sustained), protest
        withdrawn, corrective action(s) taken, decisions, etc. If not already provided directly to
        the designated AFICC OL and/or ESS/KD protest focal point, the contracting officer should
        immediately submit required information and documents (copy of protest and
        decision/adjudication, once finalized) to the focal points for upload into the AFICC Protest
        Reporting Tool.</p>

        venue (Agency, Government Accountability Office (GAO) or U.S. Court of Federal Claims
        (COFC), designated AFICC OL and/or ESS/KD protest focal points should notify their
