         <p class="p Normal">This PGI establishes the AFMC standardized process
        for Contracting Unit Self-Inspections of awarded actions using the <a class="xref" href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/self_inspection_checklist.xlsx" target="_blank">

            </a>. Each Center and Operating Location (OL) contracting unit (referred to in this
        document as the “Contracting Office”) should conduct unit self-inspections to ensure
        contracting actions reflect good business judgment, compliance with existing statutes,
        regulations, and policies (including AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System’s purpose
        to identify, and report issues); and enable proactive trend and issue identification to
        improve acquisitions in the long term. The process addresses self-inspection from the
        identification of awarded actions below prescribed clearance review thresholds chosen for
        review, through review, trend/Area(s) of Concern (AOC) analysis, Corrective Action Plan
        (CAP) development, and data entry/final resolution. The Self-Inspection Program Monitor
        (SIPM) briefs Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) status to the SCO and actions are
        considered complete when Contracting Office SCO has been briefed on closure of any
        corrective action, and closure in the system.</p>

         <p class="p List1">Self-Inspection Program Monitor (SIPM): Responsible
        for administration of the Contracting Office’s overall Self-Inspection Program, which
        includes both the assessment of individual contract files and the assessment of contracting
        management programs. The SIPM (or alternate) is also responsible for entry, review, and
        monitoring of MICT.<span style="text-decoration:line-through" class="ph line-through"> </span>
         </p>
         <p class="p List1">Self-Inspection Program Point of Contact (SIP POC):
        The SIP POC is the liaison between the reviewed buying office, reviewers, the SIPM and the
        SCCO/SCO. Responsibilities include oversight of the review process within a respective
        buying office and collection of all inspection review sheets. The SIP POC flags all
        Critical, Significant, and Minor deficiencies as well as identifies any trends resulting
        from the unit inspection. The SIP POC is also responsible for working with the cognizant
        office(s) to create CAPs, where/when applicable, and monitoring CAPs through closure. Upon
        closure, the SIP POC should notify the SIPM of CAP completion. </p>
         <p class="p List1">Unit Self-Inspection Program Reviewer (USIP–R): For
        reviews done by other than a formally assigned Reviewer, such review(s) should be done by a
        PCO (and may be supported by a buyer). (The intent/role of the buyer is to provide a
        mentoring experience for junior contracting personnel to facilitate both thorough
        inspections and a culture of learning and professional growth.) PCOs may only review files
        within the scope/limit of their individual warrant. The USIP-R (or designee) is responsible
        for reviewing the contract file IAW <a class="xref" href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/self_inspection_checklist.xlsx" target="_blank">

            </a>. The USIP-R is responsible for verifying discrepancies are corrected/fixed prior to
        submitting the completed inspection review sheets to the SIP POC. Should an office not have
        an assigned reviewer, the individual serving as the USIP-R should coordinate efforts with
        their assigned SIP POC and/or SIPM. </p>

        Actions; second, Analysis/Trend Identification and Corrective Action Plans; and third,
        Contracting Office tracking through resolution. Unit contracting self-inspection is
        considered complete when the SIPM (or delegate) briefs the Contracting Office SCO on
        successful review of actions, and the closure of any corrective action based on finding from
        the review(s). The data/findings from informal lower organization reviews of awarded actions
        may be included in the overall Contracting Office self-inspection. </p>

         <p class="p List1"> In addition to the actions inspected to meet the
        requirements of this process, contracting self-inspections may include additional actions
        above the review threshold as a secondary quality check (and final verification that final
        contract clearance issues were adequately addressed). All reviews in the self-inspection
        should be conducted on a representative sampling of actions (e.g., purchase orders,
        contracts, supplemental agreements, undefinitized contract actions, funding modifications,
        orders, option exercises, assistance instruments, etc.). Additionally, specific actions may
        be selected (outside of random sample) due to the high visibility, or uniqueness of a given
        acquisition. </p>
         <p class="p List1">While buying organizations should also conduct
        reviews for their own internal quality control/proactive improvement, those reviews are
        separate from the self-inspection addressed by this process. However, organizations are
        encouraged to provide such results to the Contracting Office for sharing of lessons
        learned/trend analysis/correct. PZC may allow for buying office augmentation of reviews.
        Augmentation may also be used for those organizations who do not have a resident PZC, and
        virtual inspection is not practicable. </p>
         <p class="p Normal"> Larger samples may be pulled as necessary by
        utilizing a percentage greater than the 2% minimum (e.g., to ensure sufficient quantities
        have been reviewed, to verify past corrective actions, or to support training decisions).
        Samples may also include actions valued above the clearance review threshold for which no
        review was conducted (e.g., funding modifications or option exercise). </p>

        are not of the severity that they merit a CAP. Contracting Offices can designate an item as
        an AOC for local focus (e.g., based on observations from recent inspection, based on new
        regulations being issued for that area, based on a new checklist question being added,
        reading other IG reports for insight, etc.). Contracting Office AOCs should be managed and
        closed at the level they were initiated. Creation of each AOC item should include the exit
        criteria for action closure. </p>
