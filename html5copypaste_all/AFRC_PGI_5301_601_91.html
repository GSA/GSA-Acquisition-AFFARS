			      <p class="p Normal">Each contracting office is responsible for ensuring its contract actions reflect good business judgment and comply with applicable statutes, regulations and policies. The self-inspection process includes the selection of previously awarded and/or completed contract actions, both above and below prescribed clearance review thresholds, for review by the office’s Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Team. Through review of previous contract actions and gap analysis, the identification of best practices, trends or areas of concern (AOCs) should result in recommendations for sharing lessons learned, recommended areas for improvement (i.e., RIAs) and/or the development of corrective action plans (CAPs). The process is iterative and requires proactive trend and issue identification with the goal of improving the quality of the resultant contract files as well as the overall acquisition health of the unit.</p>
			      <p class="p Normal"> The Chief of Contracting (COCO) is responsible for the Contracting Office’s overall Self-Inspection Program, which includes both the assessment of individual contract files and the assessment of contracting management programs. This position is also responsible for entry, review, and monitoring of MICT. The COCO also has overall responsibility for the self-inspection process to include use of appropriate checklists, worksheets or other tools, collation of self-inspection data, completion of the&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/:w:/r/sites/AFCC/afcc/knowledge_center/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE4A45E66-F157-4D15-87F0-A6BBCF4080AB%7D&amp;file=AFRC_Unit_Self_Inspection_Report.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">

				        </a>and submission of the report within MICT. The COCO flags all Critical, Significant, and Minor deficiencies as well as identifies any trends resulting from the unit inspection. Unless otherwise directed by their senior functional leadership, MAJCOM, or Wing’s policy, COCOs can exercise their own discretion in deciding the interval of their self-inspections/assessments. However, at a minimum, all AFRC Contracting Offices shall perform an annual self-inspection which shall be completed&nbsp;<u class="ph u">NLT 15 November</u>. The Inspection results and individual review sheets as well as a trend analysis will be uploaded to a designated folder on the HQ AFRC PK SharePoint. </p>
			      <p class="p Normal">Based on the volume and complexity of actions to be reviewed, the COCO assigns an appropriate number of assessors to complete the self-inspection, to include entry of all required data into the appropriate <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/:x:/r/sites/AFCC/afcc/knowledge_center/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2A852740-8B19-4D93-96A9-A29E294E049D%7D&amp;file=AFRC_Self-Inspection_Worksheet.xlsx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">

			      <p class="p Normal"> The assigned assessors should possess the minimum requisite skill level of APDP Level II in Contracting and have no less than five years of experience in the contracting career field. Reviews should be done by a PCO (and may be supported by a buyer). The intent/role of the buyer is to provide a mentoring experience for junior contracting personnel to facilitate both thorough inspections and a culture of learning and professional growth. PCOs may only review files within the scope/limit of their individual warrant. The reviewer is responsible for verifying discrepancies are corrected/fixed prior to submitting the completed inspection review sheets to the COCO. Any findings will be corrected/fixed prior to submitting/uploading the completed inspection review sheets.</p>
			      <p class="p Normal">When required, the assessors will brief the results of the self-inspection, to include open observations, corrective actions, repeat findings and all pertinent information to the COCO and/or SCO or designee (reporting requirements are determined by the SCO).</p>
