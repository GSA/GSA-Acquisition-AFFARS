When issued in a near-final state, the DRFP offers an opportunity for industry to provide meaningful feedback on the requirements and model contract that can be considered by the acquisition team prior to the start of a source selection, possibly saving time by reducing the need for solicitation amendments. It also allows for a more open dialog with industry partners in advance of the source selection, when interaction is much more structured. Finally, it allows offerors to begin developing proposals in advance of the final RFP release, allowing the PCO to provide for a shorter window of time between final RFP release and proposal receipt. Note, however, that if the draft RFP is substantially different from the final RFP, the PCO may need provide additional time for offerors to adjust their proposals. </p>
