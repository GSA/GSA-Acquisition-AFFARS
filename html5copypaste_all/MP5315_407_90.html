            <strong class="ph b">RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>: SCOs: </p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) Designate a CAFU focal point to manage the
            organization’s CAFU program in accordance with these procedures. The CAFU Focal Point:</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) Monitors and ensures proper and timely resolution
            and disposition of contract audit reports within the focal point’s organization.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Maintains current records on all reportable
            audits, from receipt through disposition. For open reports, this includes written milestone
            plans comprised, as a minimum, of target resolution and disposition dates.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Ensures that acquisition personnel within their
            organization are properly trained in the use of contract audit reports and the requirements of
            the CAFU program.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Ensures that the organization’s semi-annual CAFU
            status report is prepared in accordance with these procedures using the web-based CAFU tool
            and User’s manual located on the <a class="xref" href="http://www.dcma.mil/" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)</u>
            </a> website. When the security classification of a contract or an audit precludes the use
            of the DCMA website, SCOs must seek approval from SAF/AQCP to use alternate means of
            reporting.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Directs periodic evaluations of the organization’s
            CAFU program to determine whether they are adequate and result in timely, appropriate
            resolution and disposition of audit reports.</p>
         <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">CONTRACTING OFFICER
            (CO) RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>: The CO is responsible for reaching agreement with the contractor
            and has wide latitude and discretion in that regard. Accordingly, the procedure contained
            herein is structured in consonance with the independent, decision-making role of the CO and
            the financial advisory role of the contract auditor. COs should give full consideration to
            contract audit advice and must pursue timely and proper resolution and disposition of contract
            audit reports. Resolution of contract audit reports, other than pre-award reports, is required
            by OMB Circular A-50 to be accomplished within six months of report issuance. Disposition
            should take place as soon as possible after resolution. Per <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">DoDI 7640.02</u>
            </a>, Enclosure 3, Section 3.a, reportable audits should normally be disposed of within 12
            months after issuance. The CO must document the disposition of all reported findings and
            recommendations in a signed and dated memorandum in accordance with <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">

            </a>, Enclosure 3, Section 3.b.</p>
         <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b"></strong>
            <strong class="ph b">TRACKING OF AUDIT REPORTS</strong>: Contracting activities must track
            all contract audit reports. Tracking of non-reportable audits may be accomplished using
            records maintained in the contract file or in the CAFU on-line system. The designated focal
            point at each Air Force contracting activity maintains contract audit follow-up information on
            a current basis. The audit tracking information will normally be managed centrally at
            MAJCOM/DRU headquarters (except for HQ AFMC and SMC, where this tracking will occur at the
            field activity). For auditor-determined final, indirect cost rate reports, a report is
            considered received for follow-up tracking purposes when it is forwarded by the auditor to the
            cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) for resolution and disposition.</p>
         <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b"></strong>
            <strong class="ph b">REPORTING OF AUDIT REPORTS</strong>: Reportable audits are identified
            in the Glossary of <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">DoDI 7640.02</u>
            </a>. The information to be reported on each audit is identified in Enclosure 4 of the same
            regulation. MAJCOM/DRU/SMC semi-annual status reports will be automatically transmitted using
            the on-line CAFU system. The reports must cover the semi-annual periods ending 31 Mar and 30
            Sep and must be completed in the on-line CAFU system no later than the end of the reporting
            period. If there are no audits, a negative report must be prepared and submitted to SAF/AQCP.
            All activities must make every possible effort to ensure the completeness and accuracy of
            their semi-annual reporting submission. Special attention should be focused on ensuring the
            most accurate data is submitted on any audit listed as unresolved and over 6 months old. </p>

            contract pricing issues and are issued directly to the buying activity. COs shall provide:</p>

            Audit Agency within 60 days of receipt of the audit report; and</p>
