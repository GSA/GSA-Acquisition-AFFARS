			      <p class="p List1">(a) To facilitate timely award of sole source contract actions, contracting officers are strongly encouraged to conduct proposal kickoff and proposal walk through meetings (see <a class="xref" href="AF_PGI_5315_402_90.html">AF PGI 5315.402-90</a> ). To ensure these meetings are successful, preparation is important. The following tailorable Meeting Checklists which cover important topics regarding prime and supplier proposal adequacy are provided to guide these meetings. Contracting officers should recommend that the Prime Contractor also conduct these meetings with their subcontractors and tailor these checklists for this purpose. It is a common best practice in industry to host supplier kickoff meetings and training sessions for subcontractors that may have difficulty supplying adequate proposals.</p>

					          <u class="ph u">DoD Sole Source Streamlining Toolbox</u>
				        </a>”. The use of streamlining techniques selected as appropriate for each specific acquisition will ensure the Air Force team appropriately focuses evaluation time and effort on areas of most significant cost risk, resulting in more effective cost/price negotiations and timely contract award. </p>
