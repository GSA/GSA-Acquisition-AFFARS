			      <p class="p Normal">A Request for Information (RFI) is generally used as part of market research to determine industry interest in an anticipated acquisition; to obtain estimated prices, delivery or other market information for planning purposes; and to ensure industry understanding of Government requirements. PCOs should ensure the requirements at FAR 15.209(c) are followed and FAR clause 52.215-3, “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes”, is included in the RFI.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(a) Call for Concepts (or Concept Data Call) – a type of RFI in which the Government seeks industry information to understand state-of-the-art technologies and recommendations to formulate initial capability documents and/or identify Government technology gaps and shortfalls.&nbsp; This type of information is usually for new and emerging technologies and will require a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Life Cycle Cost (LCC) estimate with high level schedule milestones for development, initial operational capability (IOC), and long term sustainment.</p>
			      <p class="p List1">(b) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) – a type of RFI&nbsp;in which the Government posts a summary description of the technical requirement and seeks industry information to understand what sources and capabilities are available.&nbsp; Often a Sources Sought synopsis is followed by an announcement of an Industry Days or may include an announcement for an Industry Days.</p>
			      <p class="p List1" id="AFFARS_SMC_PGI_5315_3D__p__SMC_PGI_5315.3_5">(c) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) – a type of RFI in which an estimate is provided by industry at the Government’s request and may be used in the early stages of technology development or in a project when the scope and technical requirements have not been fully defined.&nbsp; Requesting a ROM may also be useful to the Government at critical design stages.&nbsp; The main purpose of the ROM estimate is to provide decision-makers&nbsp;with the information necessary to make a decision on whether it makes sense to move forward with the project based on the estimated work effort anticipated, in terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion time and&nbsp;cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; A ROM may be useful to project planners in reducing the risk of uncertainty with regard to cost outcomes for both parties when project details have yet to be identified. </p>
