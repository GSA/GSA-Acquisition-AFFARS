         <p class="p">“Associate Contractor Agreements” (ACA) are agreements between
        contractors working on government contracts or projects that specify requirements for them
        to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. </p>

        tailor each ACA to the requirements of the individual contracting situation and may consult
        with the contracting officer as required. Suggested Contract Language for Statement of Work
        or Performance Work Statement:</p>
