(For long-lead items procured with other than advance procurement funds, contracting officers should follow standard contracting procedures, including undefinitized contract action (UCA) procedures prescribed in DFARS 217.74.) </p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(b)<strong TCE:source="b" TCE:Parent="p"></strong><strong TCE:source="b" TCE:Parent="p"></strong>Contracting for long-lead items using congressionally appropriated advance procurement funds is a special contracting method used to protect planned production schedules for major system acquisitions. This approach provides Congress with the flexibility to make decisions on annual funding levels while providing a measure of program stability. Advance procurement funds need to be included in the budget request. If authorized by Congress, funds are made available well in advance of full production program release.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p  List2 ">(1) A definitive contract is preferred.

Therefore, procedures similar to those for a UCA are used to initiate the long-lead effort. In recognition of this unique situation, Congress has exempted long-lead efforts initiated with advance procurement funds from the requirements of <a TCE:source="xref" TCE:Parent="p" TCE:href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/2326.html" TCE:format="html" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/2326.html" TCE:scope="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline; " TCE:source="u" TCE:Parent="xref">10 U.S.C. 2326</span></a> (see DFARS 217.74).</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p  List2 ">(3) After the award of the undefinitized long-lead contract, the contracting officer should make every effort to negotiate a definitive contract amount for the total contract effort based on the buy profile for which the advance procurement funds were authorized. The use of a flexible pricing approach such as pricing for a range in quantity or negotiating a pricing methodology that will allow for an extrapolation of a fixed-price is highly encouraged. These techniques greatly reduce reproposal activity and facilitate a quick reaction to variations in the related end item quantity between the planned and appropriated quantities. When this is not possible and delays in definitizing the contract result in termination liability exceeding the advance procurement funds, the use of procurement funds may be authorized to avoid production breaks<em TCE:source="i" TCE:Parent="p">.
