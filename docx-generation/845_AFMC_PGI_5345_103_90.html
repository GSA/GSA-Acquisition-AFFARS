        includes property that is incidental to the place of performance; such as when the contract
        requires contractor personnel to be located on a Government site or installation where the
        use of Government-provided office space and equipment, e.g., chairs, telephones, and
        computers, is standard practice. [See FAR 45.000(b)(5)]</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(b) Base support is provided to contractors to
        preclude duplication of material and support services that would increase costs.  Base
        support includes Government-controlled working space, material, equipment, services
        (including automatic data processing), or other support (excluding use of the Defense
        Switched Network- (DSN)). </p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(c) When base support will be provided, contracting
        officers are encouraged to include in the contract file documentation, the agreements
        covering the support to be provided at specified locations.  Try to be specific and clear as
        to kind, type, quality, level, frequency and quantity of material, equipment,
        transportation, facilities, and services to be required by the contract, and list the launch
        program(s) being supported.  Try to include detailed language describing the base support to
        be provided in the statement of work (SOW)/performance work statement (PWS).  </p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(d) Proper coordination of base support needs is
        important to ensure the Government can fulfill its contractual obligations.  The contracting
        officer and project officer should assure that, prior to negotiations, all conditions can be
        met. </p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(e) Refer to <a TCE:source="xref" TCE:Parent="p" TCE:href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/ins1.html" TCE:format="html" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/ins1.html" TCE:scope="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline; " TCE:source="u" TCE:Parent="xref">DoDI 4000.19</span></a> and <a TCE:source="xref" TCE:Parent="p" TCE:href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/" TCE:format="html" href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/" TCE:scope="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline; " TCE:source="u" TCE:Parent="xref">AFPD 25-2</span></a> for additional information.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p  List1 ">(f) The following suggested SOW/PWS language may be

          recommended plan for obtaining the required support. Facilities are not be purchased under
