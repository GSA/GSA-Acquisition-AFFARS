The applicable rules addressing these information security requirements come to us from a series of Executive Orders and are implemented in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22-M), the Industrial Security Regulation (DoD 5220.22-R), and the Air Force Industrial Security Program Instruction (AFI 16-1406).</p>
			      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/airforce/AFFARS/Demo-AFFARS/dita/SMC_PGI_5304_403.ditap:2;9:53 Normal">The DD Form 254 does not itself define what information is classified – the documents that do so are typically incorporated by reference into the form – but rather it instructs the contractor how to behave when it handles and/or produces classified information. Because the DD Form 254 is the mechanism for communicating security requirements to contractors – and holding contractors accountable – solicitations should include a complete and accurate form that allows contractors to estimate the costs of the security measures it will need to provide during performance. Ultimately, the DD Form 254 is attached to awarded contracts and listed in Section J.</p>
			      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/airforce/AFFARS/Demo-AFFARS/dita/SMC_PGI_5304_403.ditap:3;10:53 Normal">The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Contract Classification System (NCCS) is the primary tool used to accomplish DD Forms 254. Generally, the DD Form 254 is prepared by the program office, coordinated through the appropriate security office(s) (see below), and certified by the contracting officer in Block 17. Contracting officers are not expected to be expert in the security requirements, but would do well to keep the following in mind when reviewing the document for certification:</p>

For all contracts dealing with classified information, this means SMC/ENX. For Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Block 10e), add SMC/INS.

There are no changes to contract terms, and the initial / current DD Form 254 is still valid (remember, there are no expiration dates associated with the Form). (See the section for Block 3b, item (2), of the Instructions for Completing DD Form 254 referenced in AFI 16-1406.) DD Forms 254 do not require re-certification or re-coordination for option exercises.</p>

Therefore, a current and accurate conformed contract is important to have readily available as a basis for sound decision-making, not only to the contracting office but also to the entire program team and staff review team. Although contracting officers are ultimately responsible, all members of the acquisition team should take an active role in maintaining the contract file and ensuring the conformed contract is up to date. As a helpful companion to the conformed contract, contracting officers may wish to keep a log (using a spreadsheet with line items for each modification is a good choice) of summary-level statistics such as contract value and funded levels (overall and by CLIN, cumulative and by modification, and broken out by component such as cost, award fee, fixed fee, etc.), accounting classification reference number (ACRN), periods of performance, option exercise dates, etc.</p>

A Data Item Description (DID) is a document that specifically defines the content, format, and intended use of required data and is included (usually by reference, unless tailored) within a CDRL. Simply put, the CDRL identifies the data required and various submission information and the DID provides the specific how-to instructions. DIDs are indexed in the Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) and can be downloaded for use by the program office.</p>
